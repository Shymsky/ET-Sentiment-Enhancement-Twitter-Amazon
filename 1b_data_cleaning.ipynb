I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it \"healthy,\" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.    199\n","Diamond Almonds<br />Almonds are a good source of magnesium. One ounce contain approximately 20% of the RDA for an adult recommended dietary allowance (RDA)<br />Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) the amounts of selected nutrients considered adequate to meet the known nutrient needs of healthy people. The RDA is based on scientific knowledge and has been presented by a committee of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS). The Canadian equivalent is the Recommended Nutrient Intakes. RDA is generally accepted throughout the world as a valid source of information. At least 40 different nations have as well as organizations have published standards similar to the RDA.<br /><br />Magnesium is the fourth most abundant mineral in the body and is essential to good health. Approximately 50% of total body magnesium is found in bone. The other half is found predominantly inside cells of body tissues and organs. Only 1% of magnesium is found in blood, but the body works very hard to keep blood levels of magnesium constant.<br />Magnesium is needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body. It helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and keeps bones strong. Magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar levels, promotes normal blood pressure, and is known to be involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis. There is an increased interest in the role of magnesium in preventing and managing disorders such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Dietary magnesium is absorbed in the small intestines. Are you taking enough magnesium in the diet? The recommended daily allowance is 300mgs/day for men, 350mgs for women. Magnesium is extremely safe by mouth - too much simply causes diarrhea. Try increasing the amount of magnesium you take by mouth until it causes diarrhea, then reduce the dose slightly so it does not. This is called taking magnesium to bowel tolerance (just like using vitamin C to bowel tolerance.<br /><br />Almonds are a good source of Fiber.<br />One ounce contains approximately 12% of the RDA for an adult.<br />So, in summary, Almonds are a very healthy snack, so what's left to say?<br /><br />Two things:<br />1st be cautious about \"bowel tolerance\" or \"happy bowels\" if you prefer.<br />2nd Taste.

Both are indoor cats in excellent health. I saw the negative review and talked to my vet about it. I've also asked a number of veterinary professionals what to feed my cats and they all answer the same thing: Science Diet. Sure, you'll see stories of how one person's cat had issues, but even if that's 100% true, it's 1 case out of millions. Science and fact aren't based on someone's experience.<br /><br />So my point is, I love my cats and I'm very concerned about their health. I trust people who actually have medical degrees and experience with a wide range of animals. My only caution is do not fall for some hype or scare tactic that recommends some unproven or untested food or some fad diet for your pet. Don't listen to me, don't listen to the negative review. ASK YOUR VET what they recommend, and follow their instructions. My guess is you'll end up buying the Science Diet anyhow.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        51\n","The pet food industry can be one of the most infuriating as you start doing research and discovering what trash manufacturers (and the vets who get paid off by the manufacturers) push onto the unsuspecting public. For reference, don't ask your vet - do some Internet research at sites like, for example, [...]. What you'll find is that even the supposed \"high-end\" lines from basically every major supermarket label are horrible for your fuzzy friends. People who trust the marketing or trust their vets overpay and feed their cats foods that are full of carcinogens, cheap ingredients that are inappropriate for a cat's digestive system, and byproducts that provide nothing of value and are basically a way to make cheap profit off of literal garbage. It's a tragedy, as these same cats end up with shorter lifespans, kidney problems, UTIs, cancer, and a host of other issues, all of which could have been avoided by a high quality food.<br /><br />This is an A-Grade food. What you'll find here is very high protein content, many meat meals, good carbs and oils, and no grains, which is great as a cat is not an omnivore, it's a carnivore, and it simply does not need grains. It has 50 percent protein, which is among the highest you'll see in cat food. The first 4 ingredients are all meats.<br /><br />What you will NOT find here is the kind of junk you'll see in things like Purina One and Science Diet - byproducts (aka beaks, feathers, bird feet), brewers rice (aka the waste product from making beer), wheat flour (a leading cause of pet allergies), corn gluten (a cheap waste of space), and things like \"liver flavor\" (because they don't want to pay for the real thing). I didn't just pull those ingredients out of the air - I was reading the ingredients list of Purina One. It's pathetic.<br /><br />Don't feed your cats trash. Pay a little more to feed them good food now, and they'll lead longer, healthier, more satisfied lives as a result. It's worth it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   45\n","I'm addicted to salty and tangy flavors, so when I opened my first bag of Sea Salt & Vinegar Kettle Brand chips I knew I had a perfect complement to my vegetable trays of cucumber, carrot, celery and cherry tomatoes. Skip the dip; balance the tangy chips by alternating bites of raw vegetable.<br /><br />As an Oregonian, I'm proud to share these delectable snacks with friends, especially those living outside our state and who haven't experienced gourmet chips. I tell them Kettle Brand does for potato chips what microbrews did for beer.<br /><br />Kettle Brand potato chips are unmistakable--a light gold color, rich flavor and amazing crunch. Kettle Brand chips are also a healthier snacking option than the major chip brands. Kettle Brand chips don't have trans fats, MSG or artificial flavors and colorings. The company also has a line of organic potato chips and all of their products are certified Kosher.<br /><br />I also recommend <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6MBV4\">Kettle Chips Honey Dijon</a> and <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6Q4GM\">Kettle Chips Spicy Thai</a>.<br /><br />Annette Solomon, a reporter for the Salem Statesman Journal recently noted that a glass of wine goes nicely with these chips. Solomon wrote, \"...you could be missing out on a wonderful pairing. These chips are spicy, so you would want to select a semi-sweet white wine. Also, a moderate amount of acid will subdue the strong flavors of ginger, lime, garlic and cilantro without over-powering them. Classically, a German-style Riesling fits these parameters perfectly.\"

Unfortunately, I was very disappointed.  I purchased both the strawberries and bananas by this company and BOTH were SOFT, not crunchy...from the very first time I opened the package!  The strawberries came in a two pack, so I immediately opened the other pack thinking the first one was just a bad batch...no, those too were very soft and chewy.  I purchase these (expensive) items because I expected them to be crunchy like the small one serving packs I purchase at Walmart.  Not even close.  Kicker of this all...you cannot return food items for a refund (this was our first time purchasing food through Amazon so I did not realized this until I went to send them back).  Not a good buy...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    1\n","I purchased this item for its place of origin.

I made them immediately and was pleased with the results. The flavor is mild but better then the plain versions I have used for sure. I also liked the light green color.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 1\n","~Taste..... I was expecting it to taste pretty close to the movies, I even added <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004W8LT10\">Gold Medal Prod. 2045 Flavacol Seasoning Popcorn Salt</a>, it didn't. It was good but not any better than the Kernel Season's Movie Theatre Butter Popping and Topping Oil that I've been using since I got my<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NCPXBG\">Maxi-Matic EPM-450 Elite Tabletop Old-Fashioned 4-Ounce Kettle Popcorn Popper Machine</a> at the beginning of the week.<br /><br />~Conclusion... decent taste but not worth the calories. I would rather save those for some <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002YLNUL4\">O'Dells Popcorn Supur-Kist Topping (Gallon) Non-Trans Fat</a> which I'm about to purchase, hopefully that's good! Now I'm stuck with a gallon of oil that I would rather not use. I would be all for the calories if it actually tasted like the movies.

Amazon Product Review dataset\n","\n","It can be seen, that the \"Amazon Product Review\" dataset has 568'454 data records with a few empty, null or na values in columns \"ProfileName\" and \"Summary\".\n","Furthermore, we can observe that there are some duplicates in the \"Text\" column, which means these are Product Reviews that have been posted multiple times.\n","After exploring the dataset in a more detailed fashion, we have noticed, that some Users have bought the \"same\" product but for example in different colors, flavours etc. and copied there reviews multiple times.\n","Additionally, some Reviews have been posted more than once for the exact same product either by the same user or a different user.   \n","\n","The histogram reveals that the dataset has imbalanced values in column \"Score\".\n","However, we would like to have two different datasets out of the Amazon Product Review dataset.\n","\n","- One with binary value for \"Score\" for further processing, as it might make our life easier. Thus, we group scores 1&2 and label them as 0, while scores 4&5 will be labelled as 1. Since we assume a score of 3 stands for \"neutral\" Review, we negelect them and drop these data records. --> But this data set is not part of the scope of this project\n","- The second one with the inital Score values ranging from 1-5.\n","\n","For the analysis of this project we only need the column **\"Text\"** as our input feature and column **\"Score\"** which serves as label vector.

I have 2 large dogs so sometimes I go through 5 cans a day. I've mostly purchased through Amazon. This past order, I opened a can of  Chicken Pot Pie which is supposed to be 'chunk' style with clearly identifiable peas, potatoes, etc. This time, I opened a can and it was mush food. Not knowing how it got messed up in the processing plant, I did not feed it to my dogs (thus losing the $2.30 that I paid for the can). I immediately went to Amazon.com AND Blue Buffalo and wrote to their customer service departments about this. NEITHER company has contacted me back and that was 3 weeks ago! So, I decided to start randomly opening the other cans (they all came in one 12-can carton that was wrapped in plastic) to see if all the cans were wrong.  Fortunately, they were not wrong so somehow the company mislabeled one of the cans during processing. The reason that this could be extremely dangerous for us is if it was beef as one of my dogs has so many bowel issues after eating beef that I only give him poultry and fish products.  Luckily, I did not feed them this can and threw it away.  However, this has tarnished my trust in this company. At the very least, either AMAZON or Blue Buffalo should have responded to my concerns. I've been waiting to get an email asking for my 'review' because I feel this is the only forum that will give any attention to this potential problem that other people could experience. My dogs are precious to me and I go to great lengths to exercise and nourish them which means I have to put trust in other companies to help me do just that.

because of all the good reviews about blue buffalo dog food i've been using this expensive dog food for about 6 months i have 2 large dogs so sometimes i go through 5 cans a day i've mostly purchased through amazon this past order i opened a can of chicken pot pie which is supposed to be 'chunk' style with clearly identifiable peas potatoes etc this time i opened a can and it was mush food not knowing how it got messed up in the processing plant i did not feed it to my dogs thus losing the $230 that i paid for the can i immediately went to amazoncom and blue buffalo and wrote to their customer service departments about this neither company has contacted me back and that was 3 weeks ago so i decided to start randomly opening the other cans they all came in one 12can carton that was wrapped in plastic to see if all the cans were wrong fortunately they were not wrong so somehow the company mislabeled one of the cans during processing the reason that this could be extremely dangerous for us is if it was beef as one of my dogs has so many bowel issues after eating beef that i only give him poultry and fish products luckily i did not feed them this can and threw it away however this has tarnished my trust in this company at the very least either amazon or blue buffalo should have responded to my concerns i've been waiting to get an email asking for my 'review' because i feel this is the only forum that will give any attention to this potential problem that other people could experience my dogs are precious to me and i go to great lengths to exercise and nourish them which means i have to put trust in other companies to help me do just that i'm now looking for homemade dog food receipes and have started making some myself this past week i hope this was helpful to you  \\\n","1

reported quality of the ingredients my old kitty wouldn't touch it we tried with trial bags  so i was excited when the new kitten was home and it was time to get her some food that wasn't purina crpwhooo boy  do i resonate with the reviewer who's poor kitty had stinky poo as you know kitties are very clean and they don't like to stink anywhere poor little sky kitten had the worst farts i've smelled and that means a human too  and loose stool she stopped having healthy bowel movements and often cried when she was in her litter box it was either the treats or the food  and since the food smelled icky we took a few days and transitioned her to the merrick before grain chicken we kept feeding her the treats so we could find out in a singular fashion what product was causing her distress as soon as she was on the merrick for four days  no more stinky kitty stinky poo or loose stoolsorry blue diamond i triednow i have this huge bag of food and no idea what to do with it sigh it's like

food for about 6 months. I have 2 large dogs so sometimes I go through 5 cans a day. I've mostly purchased through Amazon. This past order, I opened a can of  Chicken Pot Pie which is supposed to be 'chunk' style with clearly identifiable peas, potatoes, etc. This time, I opened a can and it was mush food. Not knowing how it got messed up in the processing plant, I did not feed it to my dogs (thus losing the $2.30 that I paid for the can). I immediately went to Amazon.com AND Blue Buffalo and wrote to their customer service departments about this. NEITHER company has contacted me back and that was 3 weeks ago! So, I decided to start randomly opening the other cans (they all came in one 12-can carton that was wrapped in plastic) to see if all the cans were wrong.  Fortunately, they were not wrong so somehow the company mislabeled one of the cans during processing. The reason that this could be extremely dangerous for us is if it was beef as one of my dogs has so many bowel issues after eating beef that I only give him poultry and fish products.  Luckily, I did not feed them this can and threw it away.  However, this has tarnished my trust in this company. At the very least, either AMAZON or Blue Buffalo should have responded to my concerns. I've been waiting to get an email asking for my 'review' because I feel this is the only forum that will give any attention to this potential problem that other people could experience. My dogs are precious to me and I go to great lengths to exercise and nourish them which means I have to put trust in other companies to help me do just that. I'm now looking for homemade dog food receipes and have started making some myself this past week. I hope this was helpful to you.  \n","1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Please, oh please someone tell me why i should pay 21+ dollars for a 24 pack of soda that costs 7 bucks at ANY retail store...

My old kitty wouldn't touch it- we tried with \"trial bags\" - so I was excited when the new kitten was home and it was time to get her some food that wasn't Purina cr+p.<br /><br />WHOOO BOY - do I resonate with the reviewer who's poor kitty had stinky poo. As you know, kitties are very clean, and they don't like to stink anywhere. Poor little Sky kitten had the worst farts I've smelled, and that means a human too - and loose stool, she stopped having healthy bowel movements and often cried when she was in her litter box. It was either the treats or the food - and since the food smelled icky, we took a few days and transitioned her to the Merrick Before Grain Chicken. (we kept feeding her the treats so we could find out in a singular fashion what product was causing her distress). As soon as she was on the Merrick for four days - no more stinky kitty, stinky poo or loose stool.<br /><br />Sorry Blue Diamond, I tried!<br />Now I have this huge bag of food, and no idea what to do with it. Sigh.

Great after school snacks and encourages the kids to eat more nuts.  \n","393564                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               For a afternoon snack this is perfect...Not real filling, but yet you feel like you have had something to eat.<br /><br />Real nice nutty taste without being overly STICKY too....very good !<br /><br />I will buy more !  \n","393565                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            I don't know why other people were complaining about it being too hard.

In fact, many of the products that I buy now are organic.  While not organic, these all natural trail mix bars from Nature Valley are wonderful.  No artificial colors, flavors, or preservatives are in these bars!  We do not need artificial crap in order to make food taste good.  Nature provides that itself!  I think that it's great having these kind of all natural products to choose from when it comes to snacks and eating healthy.  Highly recommended.  \n","393567

losing the $230 that i paid for the can i immediately went to amazoncom and blue buffalo and wrote to their customer service departments about this neither company has contacted me back and that was 3 weeks ago so i decided to start randomly opening the other cans they all came in one 12can carton that was wrapped in plastic to see if all the cans were wrong fortunately they were not wrong so somehow the company mislabeled one of the cans during processing the reason that this could be extremely dangerous for us is if it was beef as one of my dogs has so many bowel issues after eating beef that i only give him poultry and fish products luckily i did not feed them this can and threw it away however this has tarnished my trust in this company at the very least either amazon or blue

I hope this was helpful to you.</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>please oh please someone tell me why i should pay 21 dollars for a 24 pack of soda that costs 7 bucks at any retail store this has to be a joke would give this zero stars if i could</td>\n","      <td>Please, oh please someone tell me why i should pay 21+ dollars for a 24 pack of soda that costs 7 bucks at ANY retail store...

My old kitty wouldn't touch it- we tried with \"trial bags\" - so I was excited when the new kitten was home and it was time to get her some food that wasn't Purina cr+p.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHOOO BOY - do I resonate with the reviewer who's poor kitty had stinky poo. As you know, kitties are very clean, and they don't like to stink anywhere. Poor little Sky kitten had the worst farts I've smelled, and that means a human too - and loose stool, she stopped having healthy bowel movements and often cried when she was in her litter box. It was either the treats or the food - and since the food smelled icky, we took a few days and transitioned her to the Merrick Before Grain Chicken. (we kept feeding her the treats so we could find out in a singular fashion what product was causing her distress). As soon as she was on the Merrick for four days - no more stinky kitty, stinky poo or loose stool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry Blue Diamond, I tried!&lt;br /&gt;Now I have this huge bag of food, and no idea what to do with it. Sigh.

because of all the good reviews about blue buffalo dog food i've been using this expensive dog food for about 6 months i have 2 large dogs so sometimes i go through 5 cans a day i've mostly purchased through amazon this past order i opened a can of chicken pot pie which is supposed to be 'chunk' style with clearly identifiable peas potatoes etc this time i opened a can and it was mush food not knowing how it got messed up in the processing plant i did not feed it to my dogs thus losing the $230 that i paid for the can i immediately went to amazoncom and blue buffalo and wrote to their customer service departments about this neither company has contacted me back and that was 3 weeks ago so i decided to start randomly opening the other cans they all came in one 12can carton that was wrapped in plastic to see if all the cans were wrong fortunately they were not wrong so somehow the company mislabeled one of the cans during processing the reason that this could be extremely dangerous for us is if it was beef as one of my dogs has so many bowel issues after eating beef that i only give him poultry and fish products luckily i did not feed them this can and threw it away however this has tarnished my trust in this company at the very least either amazon or blue buffalo should have responded to my concerns i've been waiting to get an email asking for my 'review' because i feel this is the only forum that will give any attention to this potential problem that other people could experience my dogs are precious to me and i go to great lengths to exercise and nourish them which means i have to put trust in other companies to help me do just that i'm now looking for homemade dog food receipes and have started making some myself this past week i hope this

food for about 6 months. I have 2 large dogs so sometimes I go through 5 cans a day. I've mostly purchased through Amazon. This past order, I opened a can of  Chicken Pot Pie which is supposed to be 'chunk' style with clearly identifiable peas, potatoes, etc. This time, I opened a can and it was mush food. Not knowing how it got messed up in the processing plant, I did not feed it to my dogs (thus losing the $2.30 that I paid for the can). I immediately went to Amazon.com AND Blue Buffalo and wrote to their customer service departments about this. NEITHER company has contacted me back and that was 3 weeks ago! So, I decided to start randomly opening the other cans (they all came in one 12-can carton that was wrapped in plastic) to see if all the cans were wrong.  Fortunately, they were not wrong so somehow the company mislabeled one of the cans during processing. The reason that this could be extremely dangerous for us is if it was beef as one of my dogs has so many bowel issues after eating beef that I only give him poultry and fish products.  Luckily, I did not feed them this can and threw it away.  However, this has tarnished my trust in this company. At the very least, either AMAZON or Blue Buffalo should have responded to my concerns. I've been waiting to get an email asking for my 'review' because I feel this is the only forum that will give any attention to this potential problem that other people could experience. My dogs are precious to me and I go to great lengths to exercise and nourish them which means I have to put trust in other companies to help me do just that. I'm now looking for homemade dog food receipes and have started making some myself this past week. I hope this was helpful to you.  \n","1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Please, oh please someone tell me why i should pay 21+ dollars for a 24 pack of soda that costs 7 bucks at ANY retail store...

My old kitty wouldn't touch it- we tried with \"trial bags\" - so I was excited when the new kitten was home and it was time to get her some food that wasn't Purina cr+p.<br /><br />WHOOO BOY - do I resonate with the reviewer who's poor kitty had stinky poo. As you know, kitties are very clean, and they don't like to stink anywhere. Poor little Sky kitten had the worst farts I've smelled, and that means a human too - and loose stool, she stopped having healthy bowel movements and often cried when she was in her litter box. It was either the treats or the food - and since the food smelled icky, we took a few days and transitioned her to the Merrick Before Grain Chicken. (we kept feeding her the treats so we could find out in a singular fashion what product was causing her distress). As soon as she was on the Merrick for four days - no more stinky kitty, stinky poo or loose stool.<br /><br />Sorry Blue Diamond, I tried!<br />Now I have this huge bag of food, and no idea what to do with it. Sigh. It's like tossing money down the toilet.  \n","3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ZERO STARS!!!

The Nature valley promo was a great incentive to buy.  Product was received in timely fashion and we sure enjoy having them around. Getting ready to purchase some more.  Great after school snacks and encourages the kids to eat more nuts.  \n","363812                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               For a afternoon snack this is perfect...Not real filling, but yet you feel like you have had something to eat.<br /><br />Real nice nutty taste without being overly STICKY too....very good !<br /><br />I will buy more !  \n","363813                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            I don't know why other people were complaining about it being too hard. I mean, it has nuts, and the nuts aren't the softest is the world, but nothing to be upset about. My only problems is that it gets a bit sticky on my hands, but besides that, best granola bars ever.  \n","363814                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               I'm a sucker for all natural products and all natural ingredients.  In fact, many of the products that I buy now are organic.  While not organic, these all natural trail mix bars from Nature Valley are wonderful.  No artificial colors, flavors, or preservatives are in these bars!  We do not need artificial crap in order to make food taste good.  Nature provides that itself!  I think that it's great having these kind of all natural products to choose from when it comes to snacks and eating healthy.  Highly recommended.  \n","363815                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           I am very satisfied ,product is as advertised, I use it on cereal, with raw vinegar, and as a general sweetner.  \n","\n","[363816 rows x 3 columns]"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"}],"source":["df_amazon_cleaned_binary = df_amazon_cleaned.copy(deep=True) #create copy of df_twitter_cleaned\n","df_amazon_cleaned_binary.drop(df_amazon_cleaned_binary[df_amazon_cleaned['Sentiment'] == 3].index, inplace = True) #drop rows with Score 3 (around 30k rows)\n","df_amazon_cleaned_binary.replace(to_replace=1, value=0, inplace=True) #replace 1 with 0 in column Score\n","df_amazon_cleaned_binary.replace(to_replace=2, value=1, inplace=True) #replace 2 with 0 in column Score\n","df_amazon_cleaned_binary.replace(to_replace=4, value=1, inplace=True) #replace 4 with 1 in column Score\n","df_amazon_cleaned_binary.replace(to_replace=5, value=1, inplace=True) #replace 5 with 1 in column Score\n","df_amazon_cleaned_binary.to_csv('amazon_cleaned_binary.csv', index=False) #save cleaned dataset to csv\n","df_amazon_cleaned_binary.reset_index(drop=True, inplace=True) #reset index\n","print(df_amazon_cleaned_binary['Sentiment'].value_counts()) #check value counts in column Sentiment\n","display(df_amazon_cleaned_binary)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"nTKAtdNrPkjv","outputId":"b8e07f4b-a23e-4589-8ac7-05e7e206d711"},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>Id</th>\n","      <th>ProductId</th>\n","      <th>UserId</th>\n","      <th>ProfileName</th>\n","      <th>HelpfulnessNumerator</th>\n","      <th>HelpfulnessDenominator</th>\n","      <th>Score</th>\n","      <th>Time</th>\n","      <th>Summary</th>\n","      <th>Text</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>479890</th>\n","      <td>479891</td>\n","      <td>B000Z91YTC</td>\n","      <td>A1YUL9PCJR3JTY</td>\n","      <td>O.

The smell wasn't overpowering like many cat foods.&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, I'd buy Petite Cuisine for my cats but only as a treat.&lt;br /&gt;3.5 stars.</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>563807</th>\n","      <td>563808</td>\n","      <td>B007JFMH8M</td>\n","      <td>A3IMUU0I31XF33</td>\n","      <td>Becky</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>5</td>\n","      <td>1341792000</td>\n","      <td>yummy great cookie</td>\n","      <td>yummy great cookie just like my momma makes this is deffinietely a second best of course after my moms cooking love how soft and chewy they are a must buy</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>563806</th>\n","      <td>563807</td>\n","      <td>B007JFMH8M</td>\n","      <td>A248UQ9YXAMO9Z</td>\n","      <td>Becky</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>5</td>\n","      <td>1341792000</td>\n","      <td>yummy</td>\n","      <td>yummy great cookie just like my momma makes this is deffinietely a second best of course after my moms cooking love how soft and chewy they are a must buy</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","<p>2108 rows × 10 columns</p>\n","</div>"],"text/plain":["            Id   ProductId          UserId                      ProfileName   \n","479890  479891  B000Z91YTC  A1YUL9PCJR3JTY  O.

premium Numi tea, both certified organic and kosher. The ingredients are fair trade certified organic Assam black tea, organic cinnamon, organic Chinese ginger, organic green cardamom, and organic Turkish anise. There is nothing artificial in this or in any Numi tea.<br /><br />On the box, the manufacturer writes: \"Throughout India, chai stalls are a meeting place for provocative tea and conversation. From its homeland in China, chai has journeyed as chai, th&eacute;, and tea, recreating itself in every land. Numi's golden brewed, organic Chai fuses rich cultures in a complex and hearty Assam black tea. Indian cinnamon and mild green cardamom evoke a warm balance with the vitality of Chinese ginger. The peaked, sweet aroma of Turkish anise exhilarates memories. Reminisce in aged tradition with an inspiring cup of Golden Chai.\"<br /><br />Although this is a \"chai\", note that it contains no sweeteners...I prefer this, and the anise gives a certain type of mild sweetness, but commercial chais often have sugar added, so be prepared for a wonderful no-calorie indulgence that is beautifully flavored but not \"sweet\" in the same way that sugar is. Golden Chai is also caffeinated; if you want a caffeine-free chai, try Numi Tea's Ruby Chai Spiced Rooibos Herbal Teasan instead.<br /><br />If you like Numi teas, get it---you won't be sorry. If you are new to Numi but love chai, this will probably be the best you've ever had.<br /><br />*****  \n","479892                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 *****<br /><br />Numi Tea's Golden Chai Spiced Assam Black Tea is a premium Numi tea, both certified organic and kosher.

It's a delightful, all natural tea made from ginger root, lemon grass, lemon peel, licorice root, black pepper, peppermint leaf, natural lemon flavor, ascorbic acid, and natural licorice flavor. Most of the ingredients are organic. The taste is lemony, peppery, slightly herby and a little sweet, very nice anytime, but especially after a meal. It's a very unique tea that is a true treat.<br /><br />This is my second Yogi Tea to taste and review, and I am definitely impressed with the tea and the company. Lemon Ginger Tea comes with an expiration date (a good thing, because it's not full of preservatives, plus you can tell if it is fresh). Yogi Tea seems to be another company (like Numi, Aspen, Traditional Medicinals) that values sustainable and healthy practices. Their web site has a helpful glossary of tea ingredients and is beautifully designed, with info about each tea they make.<br /><br />Yogi Tea writes this on the box about the tea's benefits: \"Lemon Ginger tea is a special healing formula designed to aid digestion, ease upset stomach and provide a caffeine-free pick-me-up. Ginger (Zingiber officinale) has been used for centuries to treat minor stomach ailments, warm the metabolism and reduce nausea associated with motion. Ayurvedic practitioners have historically regarded Ginger as the \"universal medicine\" because of the way it catalyzes the benefits of other medicinal herbs. The World Health Organization (1999) reports that Ginger stimulates the appetite and can be useful in a wide variety of stomach complaints. Made with Organic Ginger, this blend is formulated to boost digestion and circulation. The sourness of Lemon promotes the secretion of digestive juices and provides the perfect counterpart to the pungent-sweet taste of Ginger. Our formula is augmented with Organic Licorice, to support the adrenals and enhance the effectiveness of other healing herbs; Organic Peppermint, to help with digestion and reduce gas; and Organic Black Pepper, a powerful detoxifier. For centuries, Lemon and Ginger have been used together for their complementary tastes and healing properties. Enjoy a cup of Lemon Ginger tea when your tummy needs a little taming, when you need to reinvigorate your body and mind, or when you just want a delicious healthy drink.\"<br /><br />There is a warning on the box that if you have indigestion or heartburn that persists you should see a doctor. There are no other cautions or warnings on the box except the standard disclaimer that the tea is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.<br /><br />This tea has no caffeine and is entirely herbal. Note that Yogi Tea also makes a Green Tea Lemon Ginger that is mostly a green tea and that includes caffeine; the packaging looks a little similar, so make sure you're getting the tea that you want.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />*****  \n","305536  *****<br /><br />This Lemon Ginger Tea from Yogi Tea is for easing occasional indigestion and gas, and for enhancing circulation.

when this product came up for review.<br /><br />Now, since I have so many cats, my cats normally only get can food as a treat, maybe once a month. About a third LOVE can food, a third can take it or leave it, and the last third do not like can food at all. When I tried this product on my cats, over two thirds gobbled it up, only one or two showed no interest, and one (who has a sensitive stomach anyway) got sick within five minutes of consumption.<br /><br />The product has a lot of \"juice\", which I find my cats tend to enjoy. The smell wasn't overpowering like many cat foods.<br />In conclusion, I'd buy Petite Cuisine for my cats but only as a treat.<br />3.5 stars.  \n","184575                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              yes, that's right, our family has 10 cats (all rescues), so you can imagine I was pretty stoked when this product came up for review.<br /><br />Now, since I have so many cats, my cats normally only get can food as a treat, maybe once a month.
